# CSS is not easy, but it could be your friend

What we're going to cover

* why does CSS even exist?
* what is the box model, and why does it matter?
  * firefox / chrome inspector tools
  * let's try mucking around with some stuff
* ok, I've got an HTML element I want to style. what's next? how do I get things to apply here permanently?
  * inline styles
  * the `<style>` tag  
  * the `<link>` tag and external CSS
* how the browser actually renders and how it's going to use your CSS
  * css rules -- not the full story. let's check inspector again...
  * how do we know which order the rules will follow?
    * https://github.com/adrianmcli/lhl-lectures/blob/master/w3d1b-css-is-not-easy/README.md
* uh, this is all good and everything but I'm only paying attention because I want to center something!
  * let's center a bunch of different things, with demos!
  * https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/
* as you go forward...
  * draw things out on a piece of paper/whiteboard. break down the problem
  * best practices with selectors, how should we manage them?
    * keep files small
    * proper class naming is key
    * when should I use an ID and when should I use a selector?
    * stay consistent with naming!!!
  * CSS is the most modern styling tool supported by all browsers without transpilation
  * as with all good code, good CSS should be close to human-readable.
  * things related should be in the same file and close together.
